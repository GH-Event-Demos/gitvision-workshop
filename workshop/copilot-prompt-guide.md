# GitVision Workshop Copilot Prompt Guide

This guide provides effective prompting strategies for GitHub Copilot to help generate appropriate code for each outcome in the GitVision Eurovision Workshop.

## Phase 1: Setup

### Outcome: Environment Configuration

**Effective Prompts:**
1. "Set up Flutter dependencies for a project that will use HTTP, audio playback, and API integration."
2. "Create a secure API token configuration class for storing GitHub and Spotify credentials in a Flutter app."
3. "Implement a configuration validator that ensures all required API tokens are present before app initialization."

### Outcome: Flutter Project Structure

**Effective Prompts:**
1. "Create a Flutter project structure with separate directories for models, services, widgets, and screens."
2. "Set up a proper .gitignore file for a Flutter project that ignores API tokens and sensitive information."
3. "Configure a Flutter app to run in web mode with appropriate browser compatibility settings."

## Phase 2: GitHub Integration

### Outcome: GitHub API Authentication & Data Fetching

**Highly Effective Prompts:**

1. **Context-Rich API Implementation:**

```dart
// In GitVision Eurovision app, implement GitHub API integration that:
// - Fetches recent commit events from https://api.github.com/users/{username}/events
// - Extracts commit messages from PushEvent payloads
// - Handles 403 (rate limit), 404 (user not found), network timeouts
// - Uses Eurovision-themed error messages like "Eurovision break time! GitHub API rate limit exceeded"
// - Limits to 10 commits for performance
// - Includes proper User-Agent header for GitHub API compliance
```

2. **Error-First Development:**

```dart
// Create comprehensive GitHub API error handling with Eurovision theming:
// Handle specific scenarios:
// - 403: "Eurovision break time! GitHub API rate limit exceeded. Even Eurovision has intermissions - try again in an hour!"
// - 404: "This GitHub user is more elusive than a Eurovision winner prediction! Please check the username."
// - Network: "Eurovision needs the internet! Please check your connection and try again."
// - Timeout: "Eurovision timeout! Even the best performances need good timing. Please try again!"
```

### Outcome: Commit Sentiment Analysis

**Highly Effective Prompts:**

1. **Eurovision-Themed Mood Detection:**

```dart
// Create Eurovision-themed sentiment analyzer that maps commit keywords to coding moods:
// Map these patterns:
// - 'productive' keywords (add, implement, create, feature, update, build) â†’ "Productive Flow - Like Eurovision upbeat anthems! (Euphoria vibes)"
// - 'debugging' keywords (fix, bug, issue, error, crash, debug) â†’ "Debugging Intensity - Like Eurovision power ballads! (Rise Like a Phoenix)"
// - 'creative' keywords (design, style, ui, animation, theme, experiment) â†’ "Creative Experimental - Like unique Eurovision entries! (Epic Sax Guy energy)"
// - 'victory' keywords (release, deploy, complete, finish, milestone, ship) â†’ "Victory Breakthrough - Like Eurovision winners! (Waterloo moment)"
// - 'reflective' keywords (cleanup, organize, document, improve, optimize) â†’ "Reflective Cleanup - Like emotional Eurovision songs! (Arcade feels)"
// Use case-insensitive matching and count keyword occurrences to determine dominant mood
```

### Outcome: UI State Management

**Highly Effective Prompts:**

1. **Flutter State Management with Loading:**

```dart
// Create StatefulWidget for GitHub analysis with these exact state variables:
// - TextEditingController _usernameController
// - bool _isLoading (for API calls)
// - String? _errorMessage (for user-friendly errors)
// - List<String> _commitMessages (for extracted commits)
// - String? _detectedMood (for sentiment result)
// Include loading UI with "Analyzing Eurovision vibes..." message
// Show commit list with Eurovision mood card when analysis completes
```

## Phase 3: AI Eurovision Magic

// - Eurovision-specific error handling like "Eurovision judge is taking a break!"
// - Comprehensive response parsing with fallback mechanism
```

2. **Structured AI Prompt Engineering:**

```dart
// Create a Eurovision-specific prompt for GitHub Models API that:
// - Uses this exact format: "Based on coding mood: '{mood}', suggest 5 Eurovision songs matching this developer's vibe."
// - Requests specific JSON format: [{"title": "...", "artist": "...", "country": "...", "year": ..., "reasoning": "..."}]
// - Includes helpful context about Eurovision's cultural importance
// - Provides mood keywords to guide song selection

## Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for GitVision

### 1. Context-Rich System Understanding

**Strategy**: Provide complete context about the GitVision app architecture.

```dart
// In GitVision's Flutter Eurovision app (which connects GitHub commit analysis with 
// AI Eurovision song recommendations and Spotify playback):
// 
// Implement a robust error handling system that:
// - Uses Eurovision-themed error messages ("Even Eurovision has technical difficulties!")
// - Provides specific feedback for each API failure scenario
// - Implements exponential backoff for rate limits
// - Includes offline mode with cached Eurovision recommendations
// - Maintains proper Flutter state management during error recovery
```
```

### 2. Multi-Step Prompting
**Strategy**: Break complex tasks into sequential prompts for better results.

```
// Step 1: Create the data structure
Create a Dart class for Eurovision song recommendations that includes
validation for years (1956-2025) and proper country name handling.

// Step 2: Add parsing logic  
Add a factory constructor to parse JSON responses from GitHub Models API
with comprehensive error handling for malformed data.

// Step 3: Implement fallbacks
Add fallback methods that provide default Eurovision songs when AI parsing fails.
```

### 3. Constraint-Based Prompting
**Strategy**: Define clear constraints to guide implementation decisions.

```
Implement a GitHub commit analyzer with these constraints:
- Must handle rate limits gracefully with exponential backoff
- Should filter out merge commits and bot-generated commits
- Must preserve user privacy (no personal data logging)
- Should work with paginated API responses
- Must fail gracefully with meaningful Eurovision-themed error messages
```

### 4. Pattern-Specific Prompting
**Strategy**: Reference specific design patterns for consistent architecture.

```
Using the Repository pattern, create a GitHubRepository that:
- Abstracts GitHub API calls from business logic
- Implements caching for frequently accessed data
- Provides clean interfaces for commit data retrieval
- Follows SOLID principles for testability
```

### 5. Example-Driven Prompting
**Strategy**: Provide examples of expected input/output for clearer results.

```
Create a Eurovision mood classifier that maps commit messages to moods:

Examples:
"fix: resolve critical bug in user authentication" â†’ "Debugging" (like Eurovision power ballads)
"feat: add innovative UI animations" â†’ "Creative" (like experimental Eurovision entries)
"refactor: optimize database queries" â†’ "Productive" (like upbeat Eurovision anthems)

Handle edge cases like empty messages and non-English commits.
```

### 6. Progressive Enhancement Prompting
**Strategy**: Build features incrementally with clear upgrade paths.

```
// Basic version
Create a simple Eurovision song player widget with play/pause functionality.

// Enhanced version  
Extend the player widget to include:
- Progress bar with seeking
- Volume control
- Eurovision-themed animations
- Country flag displays
- Error states for unavailable tracks
```

### 7. Testing-First Prompting
**Strategy**: Include testing requirements in prompts for more robust code.

```
Create a EurovisionSong model class that includes:
- Proper validation methods
- Comprehensive toString() implementation
- Equality operators for testing
- Factory constructors for different data sources
- Unit test examples for all validation scenarios
```

### 8. Cultural Sensitivity Prompting
**Strategy**: Ensure appropriate handling of Eurovision's international context.

```
Create a country mapping service that:
- Handles historical Eurovision country changes (Yugoslavia â†’ Serbia, etc.)
- Uses respectful, official country names
- Includes proper flag emoji mappings
- Validates against official Eurovision participant lists
- Provides alternatives for disputed territories
- Respects cultural sensitivities in song selection
```

### 9. Performance-Conscious Prompting
**Strategy**: Include performance considerations in complex features.

```
Implement an AI playlist generator with performance optimizations:
- Batch API calls to reduce network overhead
- Implement response caching with TTL
- Use lazy loading for Eurovision song metadata
- Optimize JSON parsing for large responses
- Include monitoring for API response times
```

### 10. Error-First Prompting
**Strategy**: Design error handling before implementing happy path.

```
Design comprehensive error handling for GitHub Models API that covers:
- Network connectivity issues
- API rate limiting (with retry strategies)
- Malformed AI responses (with fallback parsing)
- Authentication failures (with clear user guidance)
- Service unavailability (with offline mode)
Include Eurovision-themed error messages that maintain user engagement.
```
