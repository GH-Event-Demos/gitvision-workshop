The lib/screens/ folder in your GitVision codebase contains the main UI screens (pages) of the app.

Key roles of lib/screens/:

Defines top-level layouts and navigation routes, such as the home screen, playlist screen, commit analysis screen, and settings.
Each file typically represents a distinct page or major section of the app.
Screens compose and arrange widgets, connect to providers for state, and handle user interactions.
Follows best practices for responsive design and accessibility.
Keeps UI structure organized and separate from business logic, models, and services.
In summary, lib/screens/ is where you build the main user-facing pages that make up the appâ€™s navigation and overall experience.
