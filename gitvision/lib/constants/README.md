The lib/constants/ folder in your GitVision codebase is used to store constant values and definitions that are shared across the app.

Key purposes of lib/constants/:

Centralizes static values such as app-wide strings, color codes, theme settings, and fixed configuration values.
Makes it easy to update or reuse constants without duplicating them in multiple files.
Improves code readability and maintainability by giving meaningful names to important values.
Keeps your codebase organized by separating constants from logic and UI code.
Typical examples include app titles, default messages, color palettes, and other values that do not change at runtime.
