The lib/repositories/ folder in your GitVision codebase is responsible for implementing the repository pattern, which acts as an abstraction layer between your app’s business logic and data sources.

Key roles of lib/repositories/:

Encapsulates data access logic, whether from APIs (GitHub, Spotify), local storage, or mock data.
Provides a clean interface for fetching, updating, and managing data, so the rest of the app doesn’t need to know about the underlying data source details.
Makes it easier to swap or mock data sources for testing and development.
Promotes separation of concerns by keeping data-fetching logic out of UI and state management layers.
Typically interacts with services (for API calls) and exposes methods used by providers or view models.
In summary, lib/repositories/ helps keep your codebase modular, testable, and maintainable by centralizing all data access logic.
