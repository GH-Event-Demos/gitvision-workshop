The lib/services/ folder in your GitVision codebase contains classes and logic for interacting with external APIs and handling core business operations.

Key roles of lib/services/:

Implements API integrations (e.g., GitHub, Spotify, AI playlist generation).
Handles HTTP requests, authentication, error handling, and data parsing.
Encapsulates business logic that is not directly tied to UI or state management.
Provides reusable methods for repositories and providers to fetch or manipulate data.
Follows best practices for security (no hardcoded tokens) and robust error handling.
In summary, lib/services/ is where you centralize all external service communication and core app operations, keeping your codebase modular and maintainable.
