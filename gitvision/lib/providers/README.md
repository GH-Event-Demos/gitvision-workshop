The lib/providers/ folder in your GitVision codebase is dedicated to state management using Provider or Riverpod, as recommended in your project guidelines.

Key roles of lib/providers/:

Contains provider classes and objects that manage and expose app state (such as user authentication, playlist data, or API results) to the widget tree.
Facilitates reactive updates: when data changes in a provider, the UI automatically rebuilds to reflect the new state.
Helps separate business logic from UI, making the codebase more modular and testable.
Manages loading, success, and error states for asynchronous operations (e.g., fetching Eurovision playlists or GitHub commit moods).
Ensures proper resource disposal and efficient state updates.
In summary, lib/providers/ is where you define and organize the appâ€™s reactive state logic, connecting your services, models, and UI in a maintainable way.
