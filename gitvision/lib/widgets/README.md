The lib/widgets/ folder in your GitVision codebase contains reusable UI components (widgets) that can be used across multiple screens.

Key roles of lib/widgets/:

Defines custom, modular widgets like Eurovision song cards, playlist displays, loading indicators, and themed buttons.
Promotes code reuse and consistency in the app’s UI.
Helps keep screen files clean by moving complex or repeated UI elements into their own files.
Follows best practices for accessibility, theming, and responsive design.
Widgets here are typically stateless or manage their own local state, but do not handle app-wide state.
In summary, lib/widgets/ is where you build and organize reusable building blocks for your app’s user interface.
